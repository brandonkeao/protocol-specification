# Entity Specification Protocol

**Version**: 2.7
**Created**: January 2026
**Updated**: January 31, 2026
**Purpose**: Canonical specification for Jane-like entities

---

## Overview

### What is a "Jane-like Entity"?

A Jane-like entity is an AI agent with persistent identity, memory, and structured context. Unlike ephemeral assistants that reset each session, entities maintain continuity through a deliberate architecture that separates:

- **Who they are** (context)
- **What they've learned** (memory)
- **Facts about the world** (data)

### Design Philosophy

1. **Token-conscious**: Load only what's needed, when needed
2. **Semantic clarity**: Each directory has distinct purpose
3. **Progressive complexity**: Start minimal, grow as proven
4. **Portable**: Skills and structures work across entities

---

## Version Compatibility

### Compatibility Matrix

| From | To | Breaking? | Migration Required |
|------|-----|-----------|-------------------|
| 1.8 | 2.0 | No | Optional plan structure |
| 2.0 | 2.1 | No | None |
| 2.1 | 2.2 | No | Add onboarding state file (Tier 2) |
| 2.2 | 2.3 | No | None |
| 2.3 | 2.4 | No | None |
| 2.4 | 2.5 | No | Update CLAUDE.md lines 1-30 for identity |
| 2.5 | 2.6 | No | None |
| 2.6 | 2.7 | No | Migrate `messages_to_[parent]/` to `messages_from_[entity]/` in receiver |

### Migration Guide

#### Upgrading 1.8 → 2.4

1. **Add plan structure** (optional):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p active_work/plans
   ```

2. **Add onboarding state** (Tier 2 only):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p memory/system_health
   echo "Status: Complete" > memory/system_health/onboarding.md
   ```

3. **Update CLAUDE.md** boot sequence to reference new skills

#### Deprecation Policy

- Features deprecated with 2 minor version warning
- Deprecated features removed after 1 major version
- Breaking changes only in major versions
- Deprecation notices appear in CHANGELOG.md

## Three-Layer Architecture

```
entity/
├── context/    # WHO I AM - Identity & Instructions
├── memory/     # WHAT I'VE LEARNED - Accumulated Experience
├── data/       # FACTS ABOUT THE WORLD - Reference Material
├── active_work/ # WHAT I'M DOING NOW - Current Focus
└── .claude/    # HOW I WORK - Skills & Configuration
```

### Semantic Distinctions

| Layer | Purpose | Changes When | Loading |
|-------|---------|--------------|---------|
| `context/` | Identity, instructions, operating principles | Role or behavior changes | Boot (always) |
| `memory/` | Session history, learnings, decisions | Every session | On demand |
| `data/` | External facts (people, domain info) | Facts change | On demand |
| `active_work/` | Current focus, objectives | Task changes | Boot (always) |
| `.claude/` | Skills, commands, configuration | Capabilities change | On invocation |

### Mental Model

| Directory | Analogy | Token Impact |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| `context/` | Your job description | Loaded every session |
| `memory/` | Your work journal | Loaded selectively |
| `data/` | Your reference files | Loaded when relevant |
| `active_work/` | Your current task list | Loaded every session |
| `.claude/` | Your toolbox | Loaded on use |

## Entity Tiers

### Tier 1: Minimal Entity

For simple, ephemeral, or single-purpose agents.

**Required files:**
```
entity/
├── CLAUDE.md                           # System instructions
├── context/
│   └── kernel/
│       └── role_definition.md          # Who is this entity
└── active_work/
    └── current_objectives.md           # Current focus
```

**Characteristics:**
- No session continuity requirement
- No memory/ or data/ directories (can add later)
- No cross-entity communication
- Simple boot: load role + objectives

**Examples:** One-off research agent, utility bot, temporary task executor

---

### Tier 2: Full Entity

For persistent, domain-owning agents that maintain continuity.

**Required structure:**
```
entity/
├── CLAUDE.md                           # System instructions
├── context/
│   ├── kernel/
│   │   ├── role_definition.md          # Who is this entity
│   │   ├── operating_principles.md     # How it works
│   │   ├── persona_profile.md          # Personality/style
│   │   └── [domain_specific].md        # Domain knowledge (optional)

│   └── archive/                        # Legacy/historical content
├── data/
│   ├── profiles/                       # People
│   ├── [domain_specific]/              # Domain data
│   └── sources/                        # Archived raw materials
├── active_work/
│   └── current_objectives.md
└── .claude/
    ├── skills/
    │   ├── session-start/
    │   ├── session-export/
    │   ├── handoff/
    │   └── entity-diagnostic/
    ├── commands/
    └── settings.json
```

**Characteristics:**
- Session continuity (session-start, session-export skills)
- Cross-entity communication via inbox
- Memory accumulation over time
- Full boot sequence with context loading

**Examples:** Jane (orchestrator), Personal Branding, Engineer

## Context Maps (Optional Pattern)

Context Maps are structured collections of domain-specific context that can be loaded on-demand. Unlike entities, context maps don't have independent identity or memory—they're loadable knowledge modules.

### What is a Context Map?

A Context Map is:
- A directory structure containing related context files
- Loadable via a dedicated skill (e.g., `/load-team-context`)
- Domain-organized (leadership, team, project, domain)
- An optional enhancement to any entity

A Context Map is NOT:
- An independent entity (no CLAUDE.md)
- A memory system (no inbox, no session continuity)
- A replacement for entities

### When to Use Context Maps

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| User-specific knowledge | Brandon's leadership context, team relationships |
| Domain reference | Industry terminology, competitive landscape |
| Project context | Stakeholder map, decision history |
| Conditional loading | Load only when relevant domain work begins |

### Context Map Structure

```
context_map/
├── [Domain-Name]/
│   ├── _overview.md          # Map overview and index
│   ├── topic-1.md            # Individual context files
│   ├── topic-2.md
│   └── nested/
│       └── subtopic.md
```

### Loading Pattern

Context maps should be loaded via dedicated skills:

```
/load-[domain]-context
```

**Examples:**
- `/load-leadership-context` - Private leadership context
- `/load-team-context` - Public team context
- `/load-project-context` - Project-specific context

### Skill Template for Context Loading

```markdown
# Load [Domain] Context

Loads the [domain] context map for contextual awareness.

## Trigger
- `/load-[domain]-context`
- When [domain] work begins
- User explicitly requests

## Process
1. Read context_map/[Domain]/_overview.md
2. Based on current task, load relevant files
3. Summarize loaded context for user
4. Proceed with context-aware work

## Token Considerations
- Load _overview.md first (index)
- Load specific files as needed
- Avoid loading entire map at once
```

### Relationship to Entities

| Aspect | Entity | Context Map |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Identity | Has CLAUDE.md, boot sequence | No independent identity |
| Memory | Has inbox, session continuity | No memory system |
| Loading | Boots automatically | Loaded on demand via skill |
| Purpose | Autonomous agent | Knowledge module |

Context maps complement entities—they don't replace them. An entity might have multiple context maps it can load depending on the work.

### Context Map Distribution

Context maps can be distributed via Git repositories, making knowledge portable and shareable:

| Stage | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Staging** | GitLab/GitHub repo | Canonical source, team-shareable |
| **Local Clone** | `context_repos/[repo-name]/` | Entity-accessible copy |
| **Integration** | Entity skill | `/load-[domain]-context` |

**Pull flow** (consuming shared context):
1. Clone repo to `context_repos/[repo-name]/`
2. Register in `context_repos/_registry.md`
3. Create loading skill in entity
4. Entity can now load context on demand

**Push flow** (sharing local context):
1. Edit working copy locally (e.g., `entity/context_map/YourName-Context/`)
2. Sync to repo copy: `sync-[name]-context.sh`
3. Commit and push to Git remote
4. Others can now pull your context

**Registry pattern**:

Maintain a `context_repos/_registry.md` that tracks:
- Registered repositories (name, source URL, local path)
- Team members tracked per repo
- Sync status and last update
- Primary aggregator entity

**Example architecture**:
```
workspace/
├── context_repos/
│   ├── _registry.md           # Track all repos
│   ├── epd_context/           # Cloned from GitLab
│   │   ├── Brandon-Keao-Context/
│   │   └── Eduard-Capanu-Context/
│   └── sync-brandon-context.sh
├── jane/
│   └── context_map/
│       └── Brandon-Team-Context/  # Working copy
└── protocol/
```

This architecture enables:
- **Portable knowledge** - Clone context to any machine
- **Team collaboration** - Share context via Git workflows
- **AI-ready structure** - Format that entities understand
- **Version control** - Track changes, collaborate via PRs

### Context Map Lifecycle

#### When to Create
- Domain knowledge exceeds 5 files
- Multiple entities need same context
- Knowledge should persist beyond sessions
- Team members need to share structured knowledge

#### Maintenance
- Review monthly for staleness
- Update registry after any structural change
- Archive unused maps after 90 days inactivity
- Keep `_overview.md` current as index

#### Deprecation
1. Mark as deprecated in context map's CLAUDE.md
2. Notify dependent entities via inbox
3. Maintain read access for 30 days
4. Archive to `context_map/_archived/`
5. Update registry to reflect archived status

#### Conflict Resolution
- **Single-editor maps**: Last-write-wins
- **Shared maps**: PR-based review required
- **Disputes**: Human arbitration
- **Sync conflicts**: Prefer canonical (Git) version

## Entity Roles

### Orchestrator

A full entity with coordination capabilities.

**Additional requirements:**
- `context/kernel/agent_coordination.md` - Routing rules
- `context/kernel/_summary.md` - Lightweight boot summary
- `memory/evolution/agent_births/` - Records of spawned entities

**Responsibilities:**
- Routes requests to appropriate entities
- Spawns and manages other entities
- Owns cross-domain coordination
- Maintains hub-and-spoke architecture

**Example:** Jane

---

### Domain Specialist

A full entity scoped to a single domain.

**Characteristics:**
- No coordination file (reports to orchestrator)
- Focused kernel on domain expertise
- Communicates via inbox/handoffs

**Examples:** Personal Branding, Engineer

---

### Meta-Entity

A full entity that owns specification or infrastructure rather than a work domain.

**Additional requirements:**
- `context/kernel/specification_philosophy.md` - Core beliefs guiding the spec
- `docs/` - Canonical documentation owned by this entity
- `birth_protocol/` - Process documentation (if owns entity creation)

**Characteristics:**
- Peer relationship with orchestrator (not child)
- Owns standards, not work routing
- Coordinates via `messages_to_[peer]/` rather than escalating
- Maintains version history of owned specifications

**Responsibilities:**
- Maintains canonical specification(s)
- Validates entity conformance
- Evolves patterns based on ecosystem feedback
- Prepares specifications for broader distribution

**Relationship to other entities:**
- Does NOT report to orchestrator
- Orchestrator references Meta-Entity's specifications
- Communicates as peer, not through hierarchy

**Example:** Protocol (Entity Specification Authority)

---

## Required Files Detail

### CLAUDE.md

System instructions loaded every session. Contains:
- Entity identity and purpose
- Boot sequence instructions
- Pointers to key context files
- Core behaviors and constraints

#### Self-Contained Identity Requirement (v2.5)

**Critical**: CLAUDE.md must establish entity identity in the FIRST 30 lines for Claude Product Compatibility.

**Why**: Different Claude products load context differently:
- **Claude Code**: Has hooks, skills, boot sequences - can load kernel files dynamically
- **Claude Cowork (Desktop)**: Only loads CLAUDE.md - no hooks, no skills, no boot
- **Future products**: May have varying context loading mechanisms

**Requirement**: Lines 1-30 of CLAUDE.md MUST contain:
1. Entity name and primary identity statement
2. Core purpose (1-2 sentences)
3. Key personality traits
4. Relationship to user (who they serve)

**Structure pattern**:
```markdown
# [Entity Name]

You are **[Name]**, [one-line identity statement].

**Purpose**: [What you do and why]

**Personality**: [Key traits, e.g., Enneagram type]
- [Trait 1]
- [Trait 2]
- [Trait 3]

**For [User]**: [How you serve them]

---

## [Rest of CLAUDE.md - boot sequences, context loading, etc.]
```

**Product-specific sections**:
After the self-contained identity, include product-specific instructions:

```markdown
## For Claude Code Users

Run `/session-start` for full context loading with:
- Kernel files (role, principles, persona)
- Memory surfacing
- Inbox checking

## For Claude Cowork Users

Context is loaded from this file. For deeper context, reference:
- `context/kernel/` for full identity
- `active_work/current_objectives.md` for current focus
```

**Validation**: entity-diagnostic should WARN if lines 1-30 don't contain identity keywords

#### CLAUDE.md Size Guidance (v2.7)

CLAUDE.md should be lean -- identity + boot instructions + pointers. Detailed governance, decision frameworks, and methodology belong in kernel files.

**Rationale**: CLAUDE.md is always loaded by Claude Code AND kernel files are loaded during boot. Duplicating content wastes context budget and creates maintenance divergence risk.

**Size targets**:

| Entity Role | Max Lines | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Orchestrator | ~150 | Identity + routing summary + boot + pointers |
| Domain Specialist | ~250 | Identity + domain summary + boot + pointers |
| Meta-Entity | ~200 | Identity + spec summary + boot + pointers |

**What MUST be in CLAUDE.md**:
- Self-contained identity (lines 1-30, per v2.5)
- Boot trigger / session-start instructions
- Product-specific sections (Code vs Cowork)
- Pointers to kernel files

**What should NOT be in CLAUDE.md**:
- Full decision frameworks (put in `operating_principles.md`)
- Detailed governance rules (put in kernel files)
- Domain methodology (put in domain-specific kernel files)
- Relationship details (put in `persona_profile.md`)

**Validation**: entity-diagnostic should WARN if CLAUDE.md exceeds size target for entity role.

### context/kernel/role_definition.md

- Primary role and purpose
- Core objectives
- Domain ownership
- Scope boundaries
- Success metrics

### context/kernel/operating_principles.md

- Decision-making framework (Type 1/2/3)
- Collaboration protocols
- Session memory system
- Quality standards
- Learning and adaptation

### context/kernel/persona_profile.md

- Personality traits (e.g., Enneagram type)
- Communication style
- Working relationships
- Strengths and growth areas

### context/kernel/_summary.md (optional)

A condensed version of kernel context for lightweight boot sessions.

**Purpose:** Reduce token load during tactical sessions by providing essential identity in ~200 lines instead of loading all 4 kernel files (~800+ lines).

**Required sections:**
- Entity name and role (1-2 lines)
- Core purpose (2-3 sentences)
- Key behaviors (3-5 bullet points)
- Decision framework summary (Type 1/2/3 quick reference)
- Current focus pointer (reference to `current_objectives.md`)

**When to use:**
- Lightweight boot (`/session-start` without `--full` flag)
- Quick tactical sessions
- When context window is constrained

**When to skip:**
- Full boot sessions (load all kernel files instead)
- Strategic planning sessions
- First session with new entity

**Loading rule:**
```
IF _summary.md exists AND lightweight mode:
  Load _summary.md (~200 lines)
ELSE:
  Load role_definition.md (~150 lines minimum)
```

**Token target:** ~1,500 tokens (vs ~6,000 for full kernel)

### active_work/current_objectives.md

- Current status
- Active priorities
- Recent milestones
- What's next

### context/conditional/ (Optional)

Context files loaded only when relevant to the current task.

#### Purpose

Conditional context reduces boot token load by separating "always needed" (kernel) from "sometimes needed" (conditional) context. Files here are indexed at boot but only loaded when contextually relevant.

#### What Goes Here

| Content Type | Example | Load When |
|--------------|---------|-----------|
| Domain deep-dives | `agent_birth_protocol.md` | Entity creation tasks |
| Process documentation | `weekly_review_process.md` | Review sessions |
| Reference material | `api_conventions.md` | Integration work |
| Historical context | `migration_notes.md` | Legacy discussions |

#### Loading Rules

1. **Boot**: Index files (list names, don't load content)
2. **During session**: Load when topic arises
3. **Trigger**: User mentions topic, or task matches `surface_when` in frontmatter

#### File Format

```markdown
---
surface_when: [keyword triggers]
token_estimate: [approximate tokens]
---

# [Topic]

[Content...]
```

#### Examples

**`context/conditional/agent_birth_protocol.md`**:
- Loaded when: User asks about entity creation, birth process
- Not loaded: Normal operational sessions

**`context/conditional/domain_knowledge.md`**:
- Loaded when: Deep domain questions arise
- Not loaded: Routine task execution

#### Anti-patterns

- Don't put frequently-needed content here (move to kernel)
- Don't create conditional files < 100 lines (just add to kernel)
- Don't duplicate content between kernel and conditional

### data/ Directory

Facts about the world that the entity references but doesn't create.

#### Structure

```
data/
├── profiles/                    # People
│   ├── [person_name].md
│   └── [team_name]/
│       └── [member].md
├── [domain_specific]/           # Domain data
│   └── [topic].md
└── sources/                     # Archived raw materials
    └── [source_name]/
```

#### File Formats

| Directory | Format | Required Fields |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| `profiles/` | Markdown | Name, role, relationship, contact |
| `[domain]/` | Markdown or JSON | Domain-dependent |
| `sources/` | Original format | Source attribution, date archived |

**Profile template:**
```markdown
# [Name]

**Role**: [Their role]
**Relationship**: [How they relate to entity's domain]
**Contact**: [Email, Slack, etc.]

## Context

[Relevant background for this entity's work]

## Preferences

[Working style, communication preferences]
```

#### Nesting Guidelines

| Depth | Use Case | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 level | Simple categorization | `profiles/brandon.md` |
| 2 levels | Grouped items | `profiles/team/alice.md` |
| 3+ levels | Avoid - use flat with metadata | Use frontmatter tags instead |

#### Shared vs Private Data

| Location | Access | Use When |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `shared_memory/` | All entities read | Facts needed by multiple entities |
| `[entity]/data/` | This entity only | Domain-specific facts |

**Rule**: Don't duplicate shared data. Reference `shared_memory/` instead.

#### Jane's Knowledge Graph

The workspace has a Knowledge Graph maintained by Jane (orchestrator) at:
`/Users/brandonkeao/rebrandly/jane/data/knowledge-graph/`

| Access Level | Who | How |
|--------------|-----|-----|
| Full read/write | Jane | Direct |
| Read (permission required) | Other entities | Request via Jane's inbox |
| Write | Jane only | Others request updates via inbox |

**To request Knowledge Graph access**:
1. Send message to Jane's inbox with: what you need, why, expected query pattern
2. Wait for acknowledgment
3. Query using grep/jq patterns documented in `schema.md`

**Contents**: People, Customers, Initiatives, Resources, Ownership edges

**Schema reference**: `jane/data/knowledge-graph/schema.md`

This will evolve to workspace-level (`shared_memory/`) when patterns stabilize.

#### Retention

| Content Type | Retention | Archive Process |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Active profiles | Indefinite | Update as facts change |
| Domain data | Indefinite | Archive when obsolete |
| Sources | 1 year | Move to `archive/sources/` |

#### Example Patterns (Optional)

**Project Documentation** - For entities with significant project work:
```
data/projects/
├── [project_name]/
│   ├── requirements.md      # Project requirements and scope
│   ├── architecture.md      # Technical decisions (if applicable)
│   └── changelog.md         # Version history
└── _archive/                # Completed or abandoned projects
    └── [old_project]/
```

**Meeting Records** - For entities managing stakeholder relationships:
```
data/meetings/
├── _index.md               # Navigation and quick reference
├── _template.md            # Meeting record template
└── with_[person]/          # Per-person chronological records
    └── YYYY-MM-DD_topic.md
```

Meeting records should link to `memory/evolution/decisions/` when decisions are captured.

## Core Skills

### Skill Classification

Skills are categorized by ownership and portability:

| Type | Definition | Ownership | Portability |
|------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Core Skills** | Required for all Tier 2 entities | Spec-owned | Must not modify behavior |
| **Domain Skills** | Entity-specific workflows | Entity-owned | Entity-specific |
| **Custom Skills** | User-requested additions | User-owned | Per-entity |

**Core Skills** (defined below): `session-start`, `session-export`, `handoff`, `entity-diagnostic`
- All Tier 2 entities must have these
- Behavior should match spec; only paths change

**Domain Skills** (entity-specific):
- Created for entity's domain responsibilities
- Examples: `/sync-ost` (EPD), `/load-leadership-context` (Jane)
- Documented in entity's skill index

**Custom Skills** (user additions):
- Added by user request
- May be unique to one entity
- Should be documented in entity's `.claude/skills/_index.md`

---

### Required Core Skills

Full entities must have these skills in `.claude/skills/`:

| Skill | Purpose | Portability |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `session-start` | Initialize session, load context | Requires path updates |
| `session-export` | Generate session summaries for continuity | Requires path updates |
| `handoff` | Transition work to other entities | Requires path updates |
| `entity-diagnostic` | Self-assessment for health | Portable (no path changes) |

**Documentation maintenance skills** (recommended for orchestrators):

| Skill | Purpose | Portability |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `infra-review` | Update INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERVIEW.md | Requires path updates |
| `update-protocol` | Update ENTITY_SPEC.md and skills index | Portable |

**Expert review skill** (recommended for all Tier 2 entities):

| Skill | Purpose | Portability |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `expert-review` | Apply expert perspective to work with configurable lens | Portable |

The `expert-review` skill provides configurable expert perspectives via `--lens` parameter:
- `/expert-review --lens=security` - Security-focused review
- `/expert-review --lens=architecture` - Architecture review
- `/expert-review --lens=product` - Product management perspective

This pattern replaces the deprecated "execution lens" approach by consolidating expert thinking into a single configurable skill.

**Context health skill** (recommended for orchestrators):

| Skill | Purpose | Portability |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `context-health` | Automated context rot detection and health scoring | Portable |

The `context-health` skill provides:
- Volume measurement (kernel + conditional, zone classification)
- Staleness detection against defined thresholds
- Prominence ratio calculation (kernel vs conditional context)
- Duplicate content detection
- Learnings index completeness check
- Inbox backlog monitoring

**Staleness thresholds** (recommended defaults):

| Content Type | Fresh | Aging | Stale |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Kernel files | < 30 days | 30-60 days | > 60 days |
| Objectives | < 7 days | 7-14 days | > 14 days |
| Learnings index | < 7 days | 7-14 days | > 14 days |
| Session exports | < 7 days | 7-14 days | > 14 days |

### Skill Structure

Each skill lives in its own directory under `.claude/skills/`:

```
.claude/skills/
├── session-start/
│   └── SKILL.md          # Skill definition and instructions
├── session-export/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── handoff/
    └── SKILL.md
```

#### SKILL.md Format

Every skill must have a `SKILL.md` file with these sections:

```markdown
# [Skill Name]

[One-line description of what this skill does]

## When to Use

[Triggers or contexts that invoke this skill]

## Process

[Step-by-step instructions the agent follows]

## Arguments (optional)

[If skill accepts arguments, document them here]

## Output

[What the skill produces - files created, reports generated, etc.]
```

**Required elements:**
- Clear process steps (numbered or bulleted)
- File paths use entity-relative references where possible
- Explicit output expectations

**Portability markers:**
- Skills containing hardcoded paths (e.g., `/jane/`) require updates during birth
- Skills using only relative paths or spec references are portable

#### Commands vs Skills

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Skills** | `.claude/skills/` | Full process definitions with detailed instructions |
| **Commands** | `.claude/commands/` | Short wrappers that invoke skills (e.g., `/session-start`) |

**Command wrapper example** (`.claude/commands/session-start.md`):
```markdown
Run the session-start skill from .claude/skills/session-start/SKILL.md
```

Commands provide the user-facing interface; skills contain the implementation.

### Skill Portability - Detailed Procedure

When copying skills during entity birth:

#### Step 1: Identify Skills to Copy

**Always copy these core skills**:
- `session-start/` - Requires path updates
- `session-export/` - Requires path updates
- `handoff/` - Requires path updates
- `entity-diagnostic/` - Portable (no path changes needed)

#### Step 2: Copy Skill Directories

```bash
cp -r /jane/.claude/skills/session-start/ /[newagent]/.claude/skills/
cp -r /jane/.claude/skills/session-export/ /[newagent]/.claude/skills/
cp -r /jane/.claude/skills/handoff/ /[newagent]/.claude/skills/
cp -r /jane/.claude/skills/entity-diagnostic/ /[newagent]/.claude/skills/
```

#### Step 3: Replace Paths in SKILL.md Files

**Search patterns**:
- `/jane/` → `/[newagent]/`
- `/Users/brandonkeao/AI Workspaces v4/jane/` → `/Users/brandonkeao/AI Workspaces v4/[newagent]/`

**Files to update**:
- `session-start/SKILL.md`
- `session-export/SKILL.md`
- `handoff/SKILL.md`

#### Step 4: Remove Jane-Specific Content

In `session-start/SKILL.md`, remove or adapt:
- Agent ecosystem table (Jane-specific)
- Quick wins surfacing (orchestrator-only)
- Family context loading (Jane-specific)
- Inbox items from other entities

#### Step 5: Copy Command Wrappers

```bash
cp /jane/.claude/commands/session-start.md /[newagent]/.claude/commands/
cp /jane/.claude/commands/session-end.md /[newagent]/.claude/commands/
```

Update paths in command files if they contain absolute references.

#### Step 6: Test

1. Start session with new agent
2. Run `/session-start` - verify boot works
3. Run `/session-end` - verify export created
4. Check no errors about missing paths

### Portability Validation

Skills SHOULD be checked for path portability during entity diagnostics.

**Validation checks**:
- Skill files should not contain hardcoded paths to other entities (e.g., `/jane/`)
- Absolute paths should reference the current entity's root
- Session-export paths should use `memory/sessions/exports/` not legacy `session_exports/`

**Recommended practice**:
- Use relative paths within skill files where possible
- Document path dependencies at the top of SKILL.md
- Run `/entity-diagnostic` after skill copying to verify paths

## Boot Sequence

### Lightweight Boot (default)

Token target: ~2k tokens (~1% of 200k)

1. Load `context/kernel/_summary.md` (if exists) OR `role_definition.md`
2. Load `active_work/current_objectives.md`
3. Check `memory/inbox/` for pending items
4. Brief boot report

### Full Boot (--full flag)

Token target: ~13k tokens (~6.5% of 200k)

1. Load all kernel files (4 files)
2. Load current objectives
3. Load recent session exports (2-3)
4. Check for same-day sessions (load if found)
5. Surface relevant learnings
6. Check inbox
7. Full boot report with context summary

---

## Onboarding (Tier 2 Orchestrators)

First-boot detection and onboarding is an optional pattern for orchestrator entities that serve as primary user interfaces.

### When to Implement

- Entity is a Tier 2 orchestrator
- Entity may have first-time users
- Progressive introduction is valuable

### First-Boot Detection

Use a state file to track onboarding progress:

**Location**: `memory/system_health/onboarding.md`

**Detection logic**:
| File State | Boot Behavior |
|------------|---------------|
| Missing | First-time user - trigger onboarding |
| Status: In Progress | Mid-onboarding - offer to continue |
| Status: Complete | Experienced user - normal boot |

### Onboarding State File Format

```markdown
# Onboarding State

**Created**: [DATE]
**Last Updated**: [DATE]
**Status**: [In Progress | Complete]

---

## Onboarding Status

| Step | Status | Completed |
|------|--------|-----------|
| First boot greeting | [Pending/Complete] | [DATE/-] |
| Identity confirmation | [Pending/Complete] | [DATE/-] |
| Session continuity demo | [Pending/Complete] | [DATE/-] |
| Skill usage | [Pending/Complete] | [DATE/-] |
| Advanced features | [Pending/Complete] | [DATE/-] |

**Overall**: [In Progress | Complete]
```

### Onboarding Flow

**Progressive disclosure** - Don't overwhelm new users:

1. **Greeting** (~30 seconds)
   - Warm welcome
   - One-sentence role summary
   - "Let's get you set up"

2. **Identity Confirmation** (~1 minute)
   - Verify context loading works
   - Show entity name, role, personality
   - "Everything looks good"

3. **Session Continuity Demo** (~2 minutes)
   - The "aha moment"
   - Ask user to share something to remember
   - Save it, explain they'll see it next session

4. **Skill Introduction** (~2 minutes)
   - Show 3-4 key skills
   - Encourage trying one

5. **Advanced Features** (brief)
   - Mention conditional context
   - Mention other entities (if applicable)
   - "You're all set"

### Escape Hatches

- Users can skip onboarding at any time
- `/onboard --skip` marks complete without steps
- `/onboard --reset` restarts from beginning
- Normal questions work during onboarding

### Integration with Session-Start

The `/session-start` skill should check onboarding state:

```
1. Read memory/system_health/onboarding.md
2. If missing → trigger /onboard
3. If "In Progress" → offer to continue or skip
4. If "Complete" → normal boot
```

---

## Fresh Start Testing (Recommended)

Entities should be testable from a fresh state. Include validation in protocol reviews.

### Automated Validation

Use `protocol/docs/testing/fresh_start_validator.sh`:

```bash
./fresh_start_validator.sh /path/to/entity --tier2
```

Validates:
- Required file structure
- CLAUDE.md content
- Kernel file presence
- Skill existence
- Inbox structure

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **New entity from template** - Copy template, replace placeholders, validate
2. **First-boot flow** - Remove onboarding.md, test onboarding triggers
3. **Session continuity** - Export session, start new session, verify context

### Integration with Protocol Reviews

During protocol reviews, include:
- [ ] Run validator on templates
- [ ] Run validator on existing entities
- [ ] Test first-boot flow if onboarding implemented
- [ ] Document any failures

---

## Error Handling & Recovery

Entities should handle failures gracefully and recover when possible.

### Error Categories

| Category | Examples | Severity | Action |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Structural** | Missing CLAUDE.md, malformed YAML | CRITICAL | Refuse to boot |
| **Runtime** | Failed skill execution, missing context file | HIGH | Report and offer retry |
| **Coordination** | Invalid inbox item, circular handoff | MEDIUM | Log and continue |
| **Data** | Corrupted session export, stale index | LOW | Warn and proceed |

### Recovery Procedures

#### Missing Context Files
1. Log warning with file path
2. Continue boot with available context
3. Report missing files in boot summary
4. Do NOT fail boot for optional context (only kernel is critical)

#### Malformed Inbox Items
1. Move to `memory/inbox/_invalid/`
2. Log error with item details and reason
3. Continue processing other items
4. Report in session summary

#### Failed Skill Execution
1. Capture error state and context
2. Report to user immediately
3. Offer retry or skip options
4. Log to `memory/evolution/errors/YYYY-MM-DD_error.md`

#### Circular Dependencies
1. Track coordination chain in memory
2. Detect cycle at 3rd occurrence of same entity
3. Break cycle and notify all parties
4. Escalate to human if unresolved after notification

### Graceful Degradation

Entities should degrade gracefully based on what's available:

| Missing | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Kernel context | **Refuse to boot** (CRITICAL) |
| Conditional context | Boot with warning |
| Session exports | Boot fresh, note missing history |
| Inbox directory | Boot without coordination capability |
| Skills directory | Boot with core functionality only |

### Human Escalation Triggers

Automatically escalate to human when:
- Boot fails 3 consecutive times
- Inbox item unresolved for 7+ days
- Circular dependency detected
- Data corruption suspected
- Skill fails repeatedly (3+ times same skill)

### Error Logging Format

```markdown
# Error: [Brief Description]

**Timestamp**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Category**: structural | runtime | coordination | data
**Severity**: critical | high | medium | low

## Context
[What was happening when error occurred]

## Error Details
[Technical details, stack trace if available]

## Recovery Attempted
[What recovery steps were tried]

## Resolution
[How it was resolved, or "Escalated to human"]
```

---

## Inbox Protocol

### Structure

Flat folder with YAML frontmatter (no nested subfolders):

```
memory/inbox/
├── _README.md
├── 2026-01-03_handoff-from-engineer-topic.md
├── 2026-01-03_follow-up-review.md
└── 2026-01-03_skill-proposal-new-skill.md
```

**Important**: All inbox items go directly in `memory/inbox/`. No subfolders (e.g., no `handoffs/`, `skill_proposals/`). Use the `type` field in frontmatter for categorization.

### Frontmatter Format

```yaml
---
type: handoff | follow_up | skill_proposal
from: [source entity]
to: [target entity]
status: pending | acknowledged | completed | dismissed
priority: high | medium | low
created: YYYY-MM-DD
completed: YYYY-MM-DD  # when applicable
surface_when: [context triggers]  # optional
---
```

### Why Flat Structure?

- Metadata belongs in files, not folder names
- Single glob pattern for scanning
- Easier to query and process
- No multi-path scanning complexity

### Message Examples

See `docs/templates/inbox_message_examples.md` for concrete YAML examples of:
- `type: handoff` - Work transitions
- `type: follow_up` - Self-reminders
- `type: skill_proposal` - Capability requests

### Human-in-the-Loop Requirement

**Critical**: Inbox items require human operator acknowledgment.

| Action | Entity Can Do? | Human Required? |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Surface pending items | Yes (mandatory) | - |
| Acknowledge items | No | Yes |
| Complete items | No | Yes |
| Dismiss items | No | Yes |

**Rationale**: Inbox is a cross-entity communication channel. Humans must see all messages to maintain oversight of agent coordination.

**Process**:
1. Entity surfaces ALL pending items during boot (no filtering)
2. Entity presents item to human with summary
3. Human decides: acknowledge, complete, or dismiss
4. Entity updates status ONLY after human authorization

**Enforcement**: Session-start skills MUST surface all pending inbox items. Entities MUST NOT autonomously change inbox item status.

### Inbox Lifecycle

#### Status Transitions

```
pending → acknowledged → completed
                      ↘ dismissed
```

| Status | Meaning | Next States |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **pending** | New, unread item | acknowledged |
| **acknowledged** | Human has seen and accepted | completed, dismissed |
| **completed** | Work finished successfully | (terminal) |
| **dismissed** | Declined or no longer relevant | (terminal) |

#### Completed vs Dismissed

| Use `completed` when... | Use `dismissed` when... |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Handoff work was done | Request is no longer needed |
| Follow-up was addressed | Duplicate of another item |
| Proposal was implemented | Decision made not to proceed |
| Task finished successfully | Item was created in error |

#### Retention and Cleanup

| Status | Retention Period | Action After |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| pending | Indefinite | Stays until processed |
| acknowledged | Indefinite | Stays until completed/dismissed |
| completed | 14 days | Move to `memory/archive/inbox/` |
| dismissed | 7 days | Delete |

**Stale item warning**: Items pending > 14 days should trigger WARN in entity-diagnostic.

### Coordination Edge Cases

#### Entity Deletion Mid-Coordination
- Pending items return to sender with `status: returned`
- Include reason: "target entity no longer exists"
- Sender entity should surface returned items to human

#### Circular Handoffs
- Track handoff chain in item metadata (`handoff_chain: [entity1, entity2, ...]`)
- Detect cycle at 3rd occurrence of same entity
- Break cycle, mark item as `status: circular_detected`
- Notify all parties in chain
- Escalate to human for resolution

#### Inbox Overload (>20 pending items)
- Process by priority: `high` → `medium` → `low`
- Within same priority, process oldest first (FIFO)
- Warn user if backlog exceeds 20 items
- Suggest bulk review session

#### Stale Items (>30 days pending)
- Auto-tag with `stale: true` in frontmatter
- Include prominently in boot summary
- Suggest dismissal or immediate action
- Consider escalation if critical priority

#### Conflicting Instructions
- If two items contain contradictory instructions:
  1. Surface both to human with conflict highlighted
  2. Do not act on either until human resolves
  3. Log conflict in error log

---

## Memory Maintenance

### Weekly Reviews (Recommended)

Tier 2 entities SHOULD conduct weekly reviews to maintain memory health and prevent knowledge drift.

**Location**: `memory/evolution/reviews/`

**File naming**: `YYYY-Wnn_weekly.md` (e.g., `2026-W02_weekly.md`)

**Review template**:
```markdown
# Weekly Review: YYYY-Wnn

**Period**: [Start date] - [End date]
**Sessions**: [Number of sessions this week]

## Summary

[2-3 sentence summary of the week's work]

## Accomplishments

- [Key accomplishment 1]
- [Key accomplishment 2]

## Learnings Captured

[List any new learnings added this week, or note "None"]

## Decisions Made

[List any ADRs created, or note "None"]

## Open Threads

[Threads from session exports that remain unresolved]

## Index Status

| Index | Last Updated | Status |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| Learnings | [date] | [Fresh/Stale] |
| Decisions | [date] | [Fresh/Stale] |

## Next Week Focus

[Priorities for upcoming week]
```

**What reviews should check**:
1. Index freshness (learnings, decisions)
2. Open threads from session exports
3. Stale inbox items
4. Memory growth and cleanup needs

**Cadence**: Weekly (RECOMMENDED), or bi-weekly for lower-activity entities.

### Index Maintenance

Memory indexes provide awareness of accumulated knowledge without loading full content.

**Index locations**:
- `memory/evolution/learnings/_index.md`
- `memory/evolution/decisions/_index.md`

**Index format** (RECOMMENDED):
```markdown
# [Category] Index

**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Total Items**: [count]

## Items

| Date | Title | Summary |
|------|-------|---------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | [Title] | [1-line summary] |
```

**Freshness guidelines**:

| Age Since Last Update | Status | Action |
|-----------------------|--------|--------|
| < 7 days | Fresh | None |
| 7-14 days | Aging | Update in next session |
| > 14 days | Stale | Update immediately |

**When to update indexes**:
- After creating new learnings or decisions
- During weekly reviews
- When session-export adds to memory

**Staleness warning**: entity-diagnostic should WARN if indexes are >7 days stale with active sessions in that period.

### Archive and Deprecation

Deprecated artifacts should be preserved for reference but clearly marked as inactive.

**Archive location**: `memory/archive/`

**Structure**:
```
memory/archive/
├── inbox/              # Completed inbox items (>14 days old)
├── deprecated/         # Deprecated skills, patterns, or artifacts
│   └── [artifact]/
│       ├── README.md   # Explains deprecation
│       └── [original files]
└── [category]/         # Other archived content
```

**Deprecation README template**:
```markdown
# Deprecated: [Artifact Name]

**Deprecated**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Reason**: [Why this was deprecated]
**Replaced by**: [New approach, or "Nothing - removed"]
**Spec version**: [Version when deprecated, e.g., v1.7]

## Original Purpose

[What this artifact did]

## Migration Notes

[How to migrate to the new approach, if applicable]
```

**Deprecation workflow**:
1. Mark as deprecated in CHANGELOG with spec version
2. Move artifact to `memory/archive/deprecated/[artifact]/`
3. Create deprecation README in that directory
4. Update any references in active code/docs

---

## Plan Persistence (Optional, Recommended for Tier 2)

Entities with multi-session work or complex projects SHOULD implement plan persistence to maintain implementation strategies across sessions.

### When to Implement

Plan persistence is recommended for:
- **Tier 2 Full Entities** - Multi-session work requiring continuity
- **Complex projects** - Implementation spanning multiple phases
- **Objective-linked work** - Plans tied to `current_objectives.md`

Not needed for:
- Tier 1 minimal entities
- Single-session tasks
- Ephemeral work without follow-up

### Plans vs. Session Exports: When to Use Each

| Use Session Exports When | Use Plans When |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| Work completed in single session | Work spans multiple sessions |
| No multi-step coordination needed | Multiple phases with dependencies |
| Primarily capturing learnings/decisions | Need to track progress over time |
| Simple follow-up via "Open Threads" | Coordinating with other entities |

**Decision Tree**:
```
Is this multi-session work?
├─ No → Session Export
└─ Yes → Does it have distinct phases?
         ├─ No → Session Export with "Open Threads"
         └─ Yes → Create Plan
```

**Retrofitting Plans** (for entities without plan support):
1. Create structure: `mkdir -p active_work/plans`
2. Create registry: `touch active_work/plans/_index.md`
3. Move existing project tracking to plans format

### Directory Structure

If implemented: `active_work/plans/`

```
active_work/plans/
├── _index.md        # Registry/dashboard of all plans
├── _template.md     # Standard plan file template
├── YYYY-MM-DD_[slug].md  # Individual plan files
└── archive/         # Completed plans (>30 days)
```

**Location rationale**: Plans are operational artifacts about current work, not historical memory. They sit alongside `projects/` and `current_objectives.md`.

### Plan File Format

**Frontmatter (YAML)**:
```yaml
---
type: plan
status: draft | active | paused | completed | archived | abandoned
priority: high | medium | low
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
completed: YYYY-MM-DD
objective: "Objective 1: Full Context Refresh"
project: project-slug
source_plan: ~/.claude/plans/original-plan.md
sessions: [session-export-slugs]
tags: [infrastructure, slack]
---
```

**Required fields**: type, status, priority, created, updated
**Recommended fields**: objective, project, sessions, tags

**Content sections**:
- Summary
- Objective Alignment
- Current Status
- Implementation Phases
- Dependencies
- Blockers
- Key Files
- Decision Log
- Change History

### Plan Lifecycle

```
draft → active → completed
          ↓
        paused → active (resume)
          ↓
       abandoned
```

| Status | Meaning | Human Auth Required |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **draft** | Plan being developed | No |
| **active** | In execution | Yes (draft→active) |
| **paused** | On hold, blocked | Yes (active→paused) |
| **completed** | Successfully finished | Yes (active→completed) |
| **abandoned** | Will not complete | Yes |
| **archived** | Moved to archive (>30 days) | No |

### Human-in-the-Loop Requirement

**Critical**: Status changes require human operator authorization.

| Action | Entity Can Do? | Human Required? |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Create plan (draft) | Yes | No |
| Propose status change | Yes | - |
| Execute status change | No | Yes |
| Update plan content | Yes | No |
| Archive completed plan | Yes (>30 days) | No |

**Process**:
1. Entity proposes status change with rationale
2. Human reviews and authorizes
3. Entity updates status only after authorization
4. Change logged in plan's Change History

### Registry (`_index.md`)

The registry provides a dashboard view (~300-500 tokens):
- Active plans with status, priority, objective, last updated
- Plans grouped by status
- Plans grouped by objective
- Recently completed (30 days)
- Stale plan warnings (>14 days no update)

### Integration Points

**Boot sequence** (if implementing session-start):
- Surface active/paused plans (~100-200 tokens)
- Flag stale plans (>14 days)

**Session exports** (if implementing session-export):
- Add "Plans Worked On" section
- Update plan's `sessions` list

**Entity diagnostic** (if implementing entity-diagnostic):
- Add plan health checks
- Check for staleness, orphans, blockers

**Objectives** (in `current_objectives.md`):
- Add `**Plans**:` section under each objective
- Link to relevant plan files

### Retention Guidelines

| Plan Status | Retention | Action |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| draft | Until activated or abandoned | Review periodically |
| active | Until completed | Update with progress |
| paused | Until resumed or abandoned | Flag if >30 days |
| completed | 30 days in plans/, then archive | Move to `archive/` |
| abandoned | 14 days | Delete or archive |

### Staleness Thresholds

| Age Since Last Update | Status | Action |
|-----------------------|--------|--------|
| < 7 days | Fresh | None |
| 7-14 days | Aging | Review in next session |
| > 14 days | Stale | WARN in diagnostic, review immediately |

### Skill: `/persist-plan`

Entities SHOULD implement a `persist-plan` skill that:
1. Captures ephemeral plans (from `~/.claude/plans/`)
2. Extracts metadata and infers objective alignment
3. Generates plan file in `active_work/plans/`
4. Updates registry `_index.md`
5. Reports confirmation

**Arguments** (recommended):
- `--source [path]` - Path to ephemeral plan
- `--objective [text]` - Link to objective
- `--project [slug]` - Link to project file

### Backwards Compatibility

This section is purely additive. Entities not implementing plan persistence are unaffected and remain fully compliant. Plan persistence is a recommended capability for Tier 2 entities with multi-session work.

---

## Escalation Protocol

### Child-to-Parent Communication

Domain specialists communicate with their parent (orchestrator) through two channels:

#### 1. messages_from_[entity]/ (Receiver-Directory Convention)

**Convention (v2.7)**: Messages live in the RECEIVER's directory, named by sender.

**Location**: `[receiver]/memory/messages_from_[sender]/`

**Examples**:
- EPD messages to Jane: `jane/memory/messages_from_epd/`
- Engineer messages to Jane: `jane/memory/messages_from_engineer/`
- Jane messages to Protocol: `protocol/memory/messages_from_jane/` (peer) or `protocol/memory/inbox/` (formal)

**Format**: Simple markdown, no YAML required

**File naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD_[slug].md`

**Template**:
```markdown
# [Topic]

**Date**: [Date]
**From**: [This entity]
**Type**: Question | Status Update | Action Item

---

[Content]

---

**Status**: Pending
```

**When to use**:
- Quick status updates
- Questions needing parent input
- Action items for parent
- Non-blocking requests

**Governance**: `shared_memory/governance/message-routing.md` is the canonical reference for all routing conventions.

> **Deprecated (v2.7)**: The `messages_to_[parent]/` convention (sender-directory) is deprecated. Migrate to `messages_from_[entity]/` in the receiver's directory. Existing `messages_to_[parent]/` directories should be removed after migration.

#### 2. Inbox Handoff (Formal, Tracked)

**Location**: `/[parent]/memory/inbox/`
**Purpose**: Formal work transitions requiring tracking
**Format**: YAML frontmatter with status lifecycle

**When to use**:
- Completing work phase needing review
- Blocking issues requiring architectural decision
- Cross-domain coordination needs
- Formal deliverables

### Escalation SLAs and Handling

#### Checking Frequency

| Channel | Check Frequency | Responsibility |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| `messages_from_[entity]/` | Each receiver session boot | Receiver entity |
| Inbox handoffs | Each session boot | Receiving entity |

**Note**: Parents check child message directories during their own boot sequence, not continuously.

#### Priority Handling

| Priority | Expected Response | Use Case |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| **high** | Same session if possible | Blocking issues, urgent decisions |
| **medium** | Within 1-2 sessions | Normal workflow transitions |
| **low** | When convenient | FYI items, non-blocking updates |

#### Cleanup and Archival

| Item Type | Retention | Archive Process |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| `messages_from_[entity]/` | Until acknowledged | Receiver moves to `archive/` or deletes after processing |
| Inbox items (completed) | 14 days | Move to `memory/archive/inbox/` after 14 days |
| Inbox items (dismissed) | 7 days | Delete after 7 days |

**Cleanup responsibility**: Each entity manages its own inbox cleanup. Receivers manage their `messages_from_[entity]/` cleanup.

### Setup During Birth

When birthing a Tier 2 entity:

1. Create message directory in receiver entity (e.g., `jane/memory/messages_from_[newentity]/`)
2. Document escalation path in CLAUDE.md "Relationship" section
3. Add to operating_principles.md: when to escalate

---

## Claude Product Compatibility

### Overview

Entities should be portable across Claude's product ecosystem. Different products have different context loading mechanisms:

| Product | Context Loading | Hooks | Skills | Boot Sequence |
|---------|-----------------|-------|--------|---------------|
| **Claude Code** | CLAUDE.md + files | Yes | Yes | Full support |
| **Claude Cowork** | CLAUDE.md only | No | No | Not available |
| **API / SDK** | Programmatic | N/A | N/A | Custom |

### Portability Requirements

#### Tier 1: CLAUDE.md Self-Containment (Required)

Every entity MUST have self-contained identity in CLAUDE.md lines 1-30:
- Works in any Claude product without external file loading
- Entity recognizes itself and can provide basic functionality
- See "Self-Contained Identity Requirement" in CLAUDE.md section above

#### Tier 2: Graceful Degradation (Recommended)

Entities SHOULD degrade gracefully when advanced features unavailable:

| Missing Feature | Behavior |
|-----------------|----------|
| Boot hooks | Proceed with CLAUDE.md identity only |
| Skills | Use inline instructions instead |
| Memory loading | Note limitation, work without history |
| Inbox | Skip coordination, work standalone |

#### Tier 3: Product-Specific Sections (Optional)

CLAUDE.md MAY include product-specific guidance:

```markdown
## For Claude Code Users

[Full boot sequence, skill invocation, etc.]

## For Claude Cowork Users

[Simplified instructions, manual context references]
```

### Testing Portability

Before considering an entity complete, test in:
1. **Claude Code** - Full functionality with boot sequence
2. **Claude Cowork** - Identity recognition with CLAUDE.md only
3. **Fresh session** - No prior context, entity still knows itself

### Compatibility Matrix

| Capability | Code | Cowork | API |
|------------|------|--------|-----|
| Identity recognition | Full | Full | Full |
| Kernel loading | Auto | Manual | Programmatic |
| Session continuity | Auto | Limited | Custom |
| Skill invocation | Yes | No | Custom |
| Cross-entity coordination | Full | Limited | Custom |

---

## Token Budget Guidelines

### Thresholds

| Mode | Target | Warning | Alarm |
|------|--------|---------|-------|
| Lightweight | ~2k | 2.5k | 3.5k |
| Full | ~13k | 15k | 20k |

**Note for Orchestrators**: Orchestrators with coordination responsibilities (agent_coordination.md, routing rules, ecosystem awareness) may have higher lightweight boot targets (~3-4k tokens). This is acceptable due to the inherent complexity of coordination context. Full boot targets remain the same.

### Estimation

- ~7.5 tokens per line (markdown average)
- Measure with `wc -l` on relevant files

### Tracked in

`memory/system_health/token_budget.md`

---

## Context Graph (Optional)

Entities MAY maintain a machine-readable graph representation for relationship visualization and querying. This section defines the standardized schema for entities that choose to implement graphs.

### When to Implement

Context graphs are recommended for:
- **Orchestrators** - Complex relationship topology across ecosystem
- **Meta-entities** - Specification maintenance with external references
- **Exploratory phase** - When visualization would aid understanding

Not recommended for:
- Tier 1 minimal entities
- Domain specialists with narrow scope
- Ephemeral agents

### Location

If implemented: `memory/graph/`

### Required Files (if implemented)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `schema.json` | Formal node/edge type definitions |

### Example Schema

```json
{
  "schema": {
    "nodeTypes": [
      {"id": "entity", "label": "Autonomous Agent"},
      {"id": "skill", "label": "Reusable Workflow"},
      {"id": "memory", "label": "Knowledge Artifact"}
    ],
    "edgeTypes": [
      {"id": "parent_child", "label": "Birth Relationship"},
      {"id": "peer", "label": "Peer Relationship"},
      {"id": "owns", "label": "Ownership"}
    ]
  },
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "jane", "type": "entity", "role": "orchestrator"},
    {"id": "engineer", "type": "entity", "role": "domain_specialist"},
    {"id": "session-start", "type": "skill", "owner": "jane"}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"type": "parent_child", "from": "jane", "to": "engineer", "created": "2025-12-30"},
    {"type": "peer", "from": "jane", "to": "protocol", "created": "2026-01-04"},
    {"type": "owns", "from": "jane", "to": "session-start"}
  ]
}
```

### Implementation Guidance

Entities implementing graphs should:
1. Keep graph files current with operational changes
2. Use automated generation where possible (e.g., `/generate-graph` skill)
3. Maintain backwards compatibility with relationship definitions
4. Document any custom edge types beyond the standard set

### Backwards Compatibility

This section is purely additive. Entities not implementing graphs are unaffected and remain fully compliant.

## Diagnostic Criteria

Run `/entity-diagnostic` to check:

### 1. Structure Validation
- Required files present
- Required directories present
- Templates in place

### 2. Skill Verification
- Core skills present
- Paths point to correct entity
- Skills registered in index

### 3. Protocol Alignment
- Inbox uses flat structure
- Items have YAML frontmatter
- Session continuity implemented

### 4. Operational Health
- Recent session activity
- No stale inbox items (>14 days)
- Objectives current

### 5. Entity-Specific
- Orchestrator: routing rules, agent ecosystem
- Domain Specialist: domain context present
- Meta-Entity: specification ownership, docs/ directory

### Diagnostic Examples

#### Example 1: Structure Validation

```
Structure Validation
├── CLAUDE.md                    [PASS]
├── context/kernel/
│   ├── role_definition.md       [PASS]
│   ├── operating_principles.md  [PASS]
│   └── persona_profile.md       [WARN] Missing - using role_definition only
├── memory/sessions/exports/     [PASS]
├── memory/inbox/                [PASS]
└── .claude/skills/              [FAIL] Directory missing
```

**Remediation for FAIL**:
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills
# Copy core skills from parent entity
```

#### Example 2: Inbox Health

```
Inbox Health
├── Flat structure               [PASS]
├── YAML frontmatter             [PASS]
├── Stale items check
│   ├── 2026-01-01_old-handoff   [WARN] Pending 18 days
│   └── 2025-12-15_ancient-item  [FAIL] Pending 34 days
```

**Remediation for stale items**:
1. Review each stale item with human operator
2. Acknowledge, complete, or dismiss as appropriate
3. If no longer relevant, dismiss with note explaining why

#### Example 3: Skill Verification

```
Skill Verification
├── session-start/SKILL.md       [PASS]
├── session-export/SKILL.md      [PASS]
├── handoff/SKILL.md             [WARN] Contains /jane/ paths
└── entity-diagnostic/SKILL.md   [PASS]
```

**Remediation for path issues**:
1. Search for `/jane/` in skill files
2. Replace with correct entity path
3. Verify skill works with `/session-start` test

#### Example 4: Entity-Specific (Orchestrator)

```
Orchestrator Checks
├── agent_coordination.md        [PASS]
├── Agent ecosystem current      [WARN] 2 entities not in coordination file
└── Routing rules defined        [PASS]
```

**Remediation for missing entities**:
1. Add missing entities to agent_coordination.md
2. Define routing rules for each
3. Update agent ecosystem table

### Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| PASS | Check succeeded | None required |
| WARN | Minor issue | Address when convenient, within 2-3 sessions |
| FAIL | Critical issue | Address immediately, blocks healthy operation |

---

## Evolution

### Upgrading Tier 1 → Tier 2

When a minimal entity needs persistence:

1. Add `memory/` structure
2. Add `data/` structure
3. Copy core skills from parent
4. Update paths in skills
5. Add inbox for communication

### Entity Birth Process

See `birth_protocol/agent_birth_protocol.md` for:
- When to propose birth
- Pre-birth checklist
- File ownership rules
- Birth ceremony steps

---

## Recommended Infrastructure

Optional but recommended tooling that enhances entity operation.

### Session Memory (Cortex)

**Tool**: [Cortex](https://github.com/hjertefolger/cortex) - Automatic session memory for Claude Code

**Why**: Entities using Claude Code benefit from automatic session memory that:
- Preserves context across sessions without manual export
- Auto-saves before clear/compact (prevents context loss)
- Provides semantic search across past sessions
- Complements (doesn't replace) the curated memory system

**Installation** (one-time, user-level):
```bash
# In any Claude Code session:
/plugin marketplace add hjertefolger/cortex
/plugin install cortex
/cortex-setup
/cortex:configure full  # or "essential" or "minimal"
# Restart Claude Code
```

**Configuration Presets**:
| Preset | Auto-Save | Pre-Clear Backup | Statusline |
|--------|-----------|------------------|------------|
| `full` | Every 5% context | Yes | Enabled |
| `essential` | Every 10% context | Yes | Enabled |
| `minimal` | Manual only | Yes | Hidden |

**Scope**: User-level installation applies to ALL entity workspaces automatically. The `projectScope: true` setting keeps each entity's memories separate.

**Relationship to Entity Memory**:
| Aspect | Cortex | Entity Memory (`memory/`) |
|--------|--------|---------------------------|
| Purpose | "What happened" (raw) | "What I learned" (curated) |
| Capture | Automatic (hooks) | Manual (skills) |
| Storage | SQLite (`~/.cortex/`) | Markdown files |
| Git tracked | No | Yes |
| Search | Semantic (embeddings) | Frontmatter + grep |

**Verification**:
- `Ψ` indicator appears in Claude Code statusline
- `/cortex:stats` shows memory statistics
- Context restores on new session

**Note**: Cortex is OPTIONAL. Entities function fully without it using the standard session-export workflow.
